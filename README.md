# Wincore Windows

Welcome to Wincore Windows & Doors public facing repository.  It will not have much in it at this point as we are just starting to use GitHub and need to decide what will be public facing and what will be kept private.

Wincore Windows & Doors is a window and door manufacturer headquartered in West Virginia.

From day one, the vision and skill level of the Wincore® leadership team has been unprecedented.  And while each brings a wealth of varied window and door manufacturing experience as well as their own unique strengths and insights, all have a single, solitary vision — to create great, long-lasting customer relationships by creating great, long-lasting products.

To make great windows and doors, you need more than great people. You need a great place to work. And that’s exactly what you’ll find when you visit our advanced manufacturing facilities. Skillfully designed by experienced process managers, each step in the manufacturing process is streamlined for maximum efficiency while still allowing the opportunity for handcrafted detailing by an experienced production team. So, whether it is an order for five or five hundred, each and every customer is assured of quality-built, on-time orders. Granted, there are larger window manufacturers out there with even larger facilities. But to us, it’s not about being the biggest. It’s about being the best. After all, isn’t that the way it should be?
