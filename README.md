# Public Pages

This is an attempt at learning to use the github pages (gh-pages branch) functionality of a public repository (or a [Team/Enterprise-Plan](https://github.com/pricing) private repository).

In Markdown you can create links in two different ways. Either by using HTML or by using the Markdown Link Syntax. Opening Links in new Tabs is not supported in classic Markdown. If you still want to open links in new Tabs you need to switch to Kramdown which is a Markdown dialect and is also the default Markdown dialect of Jekyll. You can then use the following code for your links:

[link](url){:target="_blank"}
[Team/Enterprise-Plan](https://github.com/pricing){:target="_blank"}
