# Public Pages

This is an attempt at learning to use the github pages functionality (markdown files in the "gh-pages" branch).  Pages are available on a public repository or on private repositories if using a [Team/Enterprise-Plan](https://github.com/pricing).

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages from a GitHub repository.
You get one site per GitHub account and organization, and unlimited project sites.
